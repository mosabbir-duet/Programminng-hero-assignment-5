          <h3>What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            The DOM <strong>(Document Object Model)</strong> is an interface
            that represents how HTML documents are read by the browser. It
            allows javaScript to manipulate, structure, and style website. After
            the browser reads HTML document, it creates a representational tree
            called the Document Object Model and defines how that tree can be
            accessed. <br />
            <strong>Purpose of Using DOM: </strong> It’s used to help make
            website Dynamic without write markup in html. The Document Object
            Model is significant in speeding up web page loads. It’s used to
            access the content, structure, and style of a document. It allows to
            change the content, design, add new element, new innertext, add
            child, remove child, etc on structure via JavaScript. It's can speed
            up specific tasks (like dynamically adding an iframe) and decrease
            load times for pages using it.

          <h3>What is event bubble?</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            <strong>Event bubbling</strong> is a way of event propagation in the
            HTML DOM. It relates to the order in which events are propagated in
            nested elements. <br />
            In bubbling, when an event happens, the handler of the innermost
            element runs, then the parents, and then the further ancestor
            elements. In other words, events bubble up or propagate the DOM tree
            upwards.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Example</h2>
          <h6>
            Consider the four nested elements: <code>html</code> ,<code
              >body</code
            >
            ,<code>header</code> div, and <code>p</code>.

          <h3>What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            A <strong>callback function</strong> in javascript is a function
            that is passed as an argument in another function. Which is then
            called inside the parent function to complete a routine or an
            action. To put it more simply, it is a function that will be
            called(executed) later after its parent function(the function in
            which it is passed as an argument) is done executing.

            <code
              >document.getElementById('btn-ellipse-calc').addEventListener('click',
              () => { const area = 3.14 * a * b; })</code
