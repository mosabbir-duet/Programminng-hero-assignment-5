The DOM <strong>(Document Object Model)</strong> is an interface that represents
how HTML documents are read by the browser. It allows javaScript to manipulate,
structure, and style website. After the browser reads HTML document, it creates
a representational tree called the Document Object Model and defines how that
tree can be accessed. <br />
<strong>Purpose of Using DOM: </strong> It’s used to help make website Dynamic
without write markup in html. The Document Object Model is significant in
speeding up web page loads. It’s used to access the content, structure, and
style of a document. It allows to change the content, design, add new element,
new innertext, add child, remove child, etc on structure via JavaScript. It's
can speed up specific tasks (like dynamically adding an iframe) and decrease
load times for pages using it.
